## Geospatial in Agriculture

### Precision Agriculture

Geospatial technologies have revolutionized agriculture by improving efficiency, sustainability, and productivity. Precision agriculture leverages GIS and GPS to identify soil quality, moisture levels, and crop growth variations. This enables farmers to apply inputs like fertilizers and pesticides with precision, optimizing resource use while increasing yields and reducing environmental impacts.

### Real-Time Monitoring

Real-time monitoring through satellite or UAV imagery allows for early detection of diseases and pests, improving crop health management. GIS mapping also aids land-use planning and resource management by analyzing data on weather patterns, soil conditions, and crop growth. These tools support disaster management and climate adaptation by evaluating the impact of natural disasters and recommending suitable crops for different regions.
