# Reporting Issues & Errors

While we strive to keep our content up to date and our code examples functioning correctly, software dependencies evolve quickly. Occasionally, changes to these dependencies can cause code to break or become outdated. We appreciate your help in identifying such issues.

## What to Look For

- **Bugs or Errors:** If you encounter any errors or code that simply doesn't work as expected, let us know.
- **Unexpected Behavior:** If something behaves differently than described in our instructions or examples, it’s possible there has been a version change in one or more dependencies.
- **Typos and Clarification:** Spot a typo or find a section confusing? Feedback on clarity is always welcome.

Include any relevant details, such as:
