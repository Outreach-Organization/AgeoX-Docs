## What Is Geospatial Data?

Geospatial data and analysis integrate location information—often in the form of geographic coordinates—with attribute data about objects or events and temporal information describing when these attributes exist. This integration is managed, analyzed, and visualized through tools like Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing technologies, and Global Positioning Systems (GPS).

## The Framework of GIS

The core framework of GIS involves hardware (e.g., computers), specialized software for analysis and visualization, data management systems, analytical methods, and skilled personnel for interpretation. Geospatial science, or Geographic Information Science (GIScience), transcends these components to incorporate modern technologies such as smart devices, cloud computing, autonomous systems, robotics, and AI-powered predictive analytics.
