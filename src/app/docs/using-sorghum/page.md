## Sorghum's Involvement

The data used in this project originates from our research field trials focused on sorghum. These trials examine sorghum's phenotypic and genotypic traits, providing valuable insights for your analysis. Sorghum is not only a critical crop for food security and sustainability but also a powerful tool for carbon sequestration, making it a key player in combating climate change while supporting sustainable agricultural practices.

### A Climate Smart Crop

Sorghum, the fifth most cultivated cereal crop worldwide, excels in converting solar energy into biomass and is resilient to drought and heat stress. Known as a Climate Smart crop, sorghum plays a vital role in global food security, particularly in Africa, where it provides nutrition to over half a billion people.
