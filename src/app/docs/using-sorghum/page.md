## Sorghum's Involvement

At Shakoor Lab, we are working on a five-year project funded by the National Sorghum Producers (NSP) to study how sorghum, an important crop, grows under different farming methods. We are testing two types of commercial sorghum hybrids in field trials using three types of management practices: **no-till farming**, **precision nitrogen application**, and **cover cropping**. No-till farming is a method where the soil is left undisturbed before planting, helping to protect and improve soil health. Precision nitrogen application is a method where the right amount of fertilizer is applied at the right time, so plants get exactly what they need without wasting resources. Cover cropping involves planting other crops between main crop seasons to enrich the soil, reduce erosion, and benefit the environment.

The main goal of our project is to learn how different sorghum varieties respond to these common farming systems used across the U.S. We want to figure out **which sorghum types perform best in each system—especially in terms of yield and overall production**. This information can help farmers choose the right variety for their land, which improves both economic outcomes and environmental sustainability. Sorghum is not only a food source for humans and animals, but it is also used as a bioenergy crop, meaning it can help produce fuel from plants. Planting the right sorghum in the right conditions can strengthen the U.S. economy.

The data used in this project originates from our research field trials focused on sorghum. These trials examine sorghum's phenotypic traits, providing valuable insights for your analysis in this activity. Sorghum is not only a critical crop for food security and sustainability, but also **a powerful tool for carbon sequestration**, making it a key player in **combating climate change while supporting sustainable agricultural practices**.

### A Climate Smart Crop

Sorghum, the **fifth most cultivated cereal crop worldwide**, excels in converting solar energy into biomass and is resilient to drought and heat stress. Known as a Climate Smart crop, sorghum plays a vital role in global food security, **particularly in Africa**, where it provides nutrition to over half a billion people.

### Nutritional and Economic Value

Its grains are nutrient-rich, containing 12% protein and significant levels of **iron**, **zinc**, **phosphorus**, and **B-complex vitamins**. Beyond its dietary contributions, sorghum is a **key bioenergy feedstock**, making it a sustainable crop for food and energy production.

### Global Production

Sorghum is grown in all corners of the globe, with a harvest of nearly **60 M tons** in 2021. The U.S. is the **largest producer of grain sorghum**, and produced 11 M tons in 2021.
