# Geospatial and Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the **Geospatial and Machine Learning Project** repository! This project is designed to provide hands-on experience in geospatial analysis and machine learning, enabling users to predict important plant traits using advanced technologies and tools.

---

## Key Features

- **Geospatial Insights**: Work with drone imagery, climate data, and field observations.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Leverage six pre-implemented regression models (PLS, Lasso, ElasticNet, Bayesian Ridge, XGBoost, and SVR) or implement your own.
- **Customizable Code**: Tailor the provided scripts to suit your research or educational needs.
- **Educational Focus**: Designed for students and researchers to learn and apply data science skills.
